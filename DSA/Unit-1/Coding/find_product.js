Find the product of the five values, and print it

Input :
The first and the only line of the input contains five values, stored in the variablesone, two, three, four, five
1 2 3 4 5

Output :
Print the product of the five values stored in the variablesone, two, three, four, five
120

Hint :
In the sample test case, the values stored in the variables areone = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five= 5
The sum of the values is1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120, which is the required sum
